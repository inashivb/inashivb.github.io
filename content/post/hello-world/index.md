Hello, beautiful human! ☺️


## whoami

**Shivani**

I am a person who
- believes that maintaining your own health (physical + mental) is the biggest form of self-respect
- loves her family and friends
- is an average programmer who enjoys mathematics and computer networking
- loves food (eating + cooking)
- loves to travel *after* I reach the destination

in the exact priority order that these are written in.

More about me:
- I'm happy to be a part of arguments as long as they're respectful. I do not respond to
[ad hominem](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/ad-hominem.html). If you're
doing this, it's a good sign that you need more data to back your initial argument up.
- I'm learning to separate the art from the artist to continue to have shows to watch, music to listen to,
books to read, et al.
- I'm a generally happy human being.
- I believe that discipline can bring about unfathomable changes in any person.
- I think we should all make our own mini contributions in helping improve our planet's health.


### An exercise for you that I failed to understand for years

Do you think `1 != 2`? Can you prove it?

Also try: Prove `1 == 1`.


### What to expect

This blog shall be about learnings technical and non-technical. No AI will be used to write the posts.

Everything I learn is *in progress* and hence subject to change. 😉
