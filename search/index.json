[{"content":"Hello, beautiful human! ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nwhoami Shivani\nI am a person who\nbelieves that maintaining your own health (physical + mental) is the biggest form of self-respect loves her family and friends is an average programmer who enjoys mathematics and computer networking loves food (eating + cooking) loves to travel after I reach the destination in the exact priority order that these are written in.\nMore about me:\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy to be a part of arguments as long as they\u0026rsquo;re respectful. I do not respond to ad hominem. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing this, it\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that you need more data to back your initial argument up. I\u0026rsquo;m learning to separate the art from the artist to continue to have shows to watch, music to listen to, books to read, et al. I\u0026rsquo;m a generally happy human being. I believe that discipline can bring about unfathomable changes in any person. I think we should all make our own mini contributions in helping improve our planet\u0026rsquo;s health. An exercise for you that I failed to understand for years Do you think 1 != 2? Can you prove it?\nAlso try: Prove 1 == 1.\nWhat to expect This blog shall be about learnings technical and non-technical. No AI will be used to write the posts.\nEverything I learn is in progress and hence subject to change. üòâ\nLatest favorite quote Be brave enough to suck at something new\n","date":"2025-05-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://inashivb.github.io/p/hello-world/cover_hu_cef654c1ff51492a.jpg","permalink":"https://inashivb.github.io/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
